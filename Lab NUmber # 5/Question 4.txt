Add a separate class file to Console application program and create a method call private void sayHello( ).

Inside the method display hello world 

In main class create class object and try to access the savHello() method by using the class object.

Can you access the method? Explain why?

This is since a private method can only be accessed by other methods in the same class. The main class is a different class, so it cannot access the private method. This is called as Encapsulation where the paticular method is encapsulated within the paticular method.
